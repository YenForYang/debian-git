Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (GUI)
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.

 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.

 This package provides the git graphical user interface.
 .
 If aspell is installed, it can check the spelling of commit messages
 as the user types.
